Real Model
==========

A file:

MODEL_LA/.real

With:

--begin
## Model configuration file
NumberOfIterations="3" # n as integer
CodeOfEvents="0"       # 0/1
OneDOptimization="0"   # 0/1
--end

The config folder with files:

MODEL_LA/INI_PARAM/:
	1Dmod_PARAM.DAT	 # 1d Optimization file
	ini_model.dat    # Initial Model / for imposing a certain structure
	ref_start.dat    # Start model for 3D inversion
	grid_param.dat   # ? Empty file
	major_param.dat  # Main configuration file
	refmod.dat       # Reference model for current inversion, is automatically created
	sethor.dat       # Config file for horizontal figures
	setver.dat       # Config file for vertical figures
	z_limit.bln      # ? Dont know

Synthetic folder
================

A file:

MODELSLA/.synt 

with content:

--begin
onedopt=0
nit=1
--end

The following config files:

MODELSLA/INI_PARAM/:
	1Dmod_PARAM.DAT	# As in Real
	ini_model.dat	# As in Real
	noise.dat	# A file describing the synthetic noise added to travel times
	ref_start.dat	# As in Real
	sethor.dat	# As in Real
	z_limit.bln     # ??
	anomaly.dat     # A file desbrigin the synthetic test model to be used
	grid_param.dat  # ??
	major_param.dat # As in Real
	refmod.dat      # As in Real
	ref_syn.dat     # A 1D reference model used to compute synthetic travel times (reference synthetic model)
	setver.dat      # As in Real

Running synthetic tests
=======================

Before running synthetic tests you should adjust the synthetic model.  For
that you can use the two programs:

'A_SET_SYN_HOR' and 'A_SET_SYN_VER'

Those commands will generate the necessary grid to visualize the synthetic
model on the 'FIG_FILES/SYN_INI/'.

To real run the synthetic test you should attach a Synt model with:

% source SHELL/tomo.bshm
% tomo plug AREA SYNT_MODEL REAL_MODEL

you can check the correctness of operation with:

% tomo report

and finally, you can run it w/:

% tomo gosyn
% ./synth.exe

All the other stuff, is like real model.
